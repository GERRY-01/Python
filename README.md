# Prime Number Checker 🔢  

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a number is prime or not.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.  
- It then checks if the number is **prime** or **not**.  
- If the number is **less than 2**, it is **not prime**.  
- If it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is **not prime**.
